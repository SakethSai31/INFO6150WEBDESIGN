### Calculator and Stop Watch

There are 2 different webpages and javascripts used to create a Calculator web application which requires a login and predefined validations such as `Valid Email` , `Valid Password`, `Valid Username`.<br>
The Calculator application has 3 fields 2 editable and 1 for the result field.<br>
Used Switch and Case statements and defined the Arrow functions for the Arithmetic operations such as `addition` , `subtraction`, `multiplication`, `Division` 


The second web application is a basic stop-watch with 3 buttons in it:
`Start`, `Stop`, `Reset`

I have used javascript, HTML and CSS for building the application.
